# 🐵 SmartMonkey - Secure Userscript Manager

An open-source browser extension for managing userscripts, designed with a focus on **user security**, especially for **non-technical users**.

---

## 🧠 Problem Statement

Userscripts offer powerful capabilities to automate and customize web browsing, improving productivity and user experience. However, their inherent access to web page content also introduces significant security risks, especially for non-technical users who may lack the expertise to assess script safety.

Most existing userscript managers prioritize flexibility and developer freedom, often at the expense of transparency and user protection. This leaves everyday users vulnerable to malicious scripts that can compromise privacy, steal data, or perform unauthorized actions without clear warnings or controls.
